What is Alzheimer's?
-------------
Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, affecting around 35 million people today, with that number expected to grow to 65 million by the year 2030. Currently, Alzheimer's can't truly be diagnosed until after death ("The presence and distribution of amyloid plaques and NFT in the brain is used to establish the diagnosis of ‘definitive’ AD and stage the disease"). However, there are different ways nowadays at different pricepoints to attempt to diagnose. Clinically, AD is usually diagnosed by a series of cognitive tests, which reach an accuracy of around 70%-90%. While neuroimaging can give better accuracy, it is very expensive and thus rarely used. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>


APOE4 and TOMM40
-------------
TOMM40 and APOE are genes that are known to be associated with Alzheimer’s. Specifically, according to the ADNI website, “the epsilon 4 allele of APOE is the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD with a two- to three-fold increased risk for AD in people with one epsilon 4 allele rising to about 12-fold in those with two alleles.” <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> Additionally, a previous paper based on analysing ADNI genetic data found TOMM40 to be a risk gene.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> However, these genes are risk factors at a genomic level - i.e. depending on allele. We are interested in looking at the gene expression level, which reflects both different environmental factors, as well as upstream genomic mutations.


Let's unzip those genes?
-------------
We did more literature review to validate that the genes we identified were indeed significant. This review is in [the final results page](Results.md)
