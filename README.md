## Predicting Alzheimer's through Gene Expression
Class project for CS109a, Fall 2017 by Jacqueline Chea, Nike Izmaylov, Nick Pagel, and Leah Rosen.

Using gene expression data from a neuroimaging database, we built 5 models to predict diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, evaluated them to identify AdaBoost with PCA and cross-validation on the number of estimators as the best model, and implemented abstention to reduce misdiagnosis frequency.

To read through our project, the order of the pages is:
* index.md
* Problem.md
* Data.md
* Cleaning.md
* Literature.md
* Models.md
* Results.md
