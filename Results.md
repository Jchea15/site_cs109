A gene-ius look at most correlated genes
-------------
The genes we used for imputation were the ones that were most highly correlated with all of the cognitive tests. We used the genes where the p-value was less than 0.01 showing high statistical significance of the genes and thus promise that they would be useful in imputing AD diagnosis. We also wanted to see if we could identify novel genes that were relevant in AD. Below is a table of the 20 most highly correlated genes (CLIC1 occurred 3 times, and MCEMP1 twice, so in fact only 17 genes are listed). Most of them have already been linked to Alzheimer's or can be linked to a gene that has been linked to Alzheimer's, which indicates that our correlation is in fact doing a good job - yay!

Diagnosing and detecting Alzheimer's
-------------
After experimenting with many different models and combinations of models and dimensionality reduction techniques, the model with the best performance was a gradient boosted Decision Tree using PCA. For this we reached the following accuracies:

Random class. accuracy, train:  0.305882352941

Random class. accuracy, test:  0.373684210526

All zeros class. accuracy, train:  0.411764705882

All zeros class. accuracy, test:  0.415789473684

All ones class. accuracy, train:  0.4

All ones class. accuracy, test:  0.421052631579

All twos class. accuracy, train:  0.188235294118

All twos class. accuracy, test:  0.163157894737

Gradient Boost with PCA and CV class. accuracy, train:  1.0

__Gradient Boost with PCA and CV class. accuracy, test:  0.468421052632__

Gradient Boost with PCA and CV class. accuracy, improved DX:  0.333333333333

Gradient Boost with PCA and CV class. accuracy, worsened DX:  0.39393939393

Showing that our model does significantly better than any of the "lazy" models or randomness. Thus we are predicting Alzheimer's diagnosis to a certain degree, though are not able to beat the 70%-90% accuracy that using cognitive tests provide.

We then took this model a step further and implemented a cost-minimizing abstention feature.

We tested out our gradient boosted Decision Tree using PCA on the data we had left out, and saw that we couldn't our model captured a moment in time, and not progressing data. Our accuracy for the patients who's diagnosis improved was 0.33, and the accuracy for patients who's diagnosis got worse was 0.39. This shows that our model does not capture longitudinalness.

While the model does provide a diagnosis for all patients, the model is not equally 'certain' of all of its diagnoses. For that reason, we also provided the model with the ability to abstain from a particular decision, choosing thresholds based on cross-validation and a cost function rather than accuracy as well as iterating through ever-smaller windows in order to fine-tune thresholds out to five decimal points; for more information on the thresholds selected, please see [the abstaining section on our Models overview](Models.md).

To view our process, please see [our final model building documentation](Finalmodel_notebook.md).


Strengths and shortcomings
-------------

Our stretch goal was to see if we could predict progression of Alzheimer's based on current gene expression data. This would make sense, since aberrant gene expression would come before a patient becomes symptomatic, and it takes a while for the cascade to continue. We attempted this, however it does not appear as though we have enough information to really say anything meaningful about progression. Primarily, very few patients actually progressed in the time-frame that we were looking at. Therefore, our model got a training R^2 of 0.30 and a testing R^2 of -0.02 indicating that we are doing slightly worse even than just taking the average. Despite using dimensionality reduction (PCA), we are overfitting quite a lot, and not managing to fit at all on testing, and so it seems as if we simply don't have enough information to build a model. For more information, please see [our attempt at working with longitudinal data](Long_notebook.md).

As for the final model and final model with abstention, both models suffer from the same predominant weakness: a relatively low classification accuracy. The final model can reach a classification accuracy of 0.46, while the model which can abstain achieves 0.87, although it only diagnoses approximately 27% of patients, meaning its uses are more in line with those of institutions prioritizing reducing costs over delivering a diagnosis to every patient. This limits its applications, but it is useful in the correct cirumstance. The classification accuracy of 0.46 accuracy for a three-class classification problem is substantially higher than a 0.33 'random' rate (like 0.5 for a two-class). The final model outperforms baseline and random models, but is not accurate enough to be truly useful predictors. This issue could be solved if more training data were made availible (see below). 

While both models have their drawbacks, however, they also both are a significant improvement over previous methods. As mentioned above, both models outperform random chance and baseline models, while remaning relatively computationally simple and cost-effective. In particular, the models allow doctors to more accurately diagnose Alzheimer's dementia than in previous years, in  a cheap and objective manner. Diagnosis no longer requires the use of subjective cognitive tests, nor expensive PET scans.


Where do we go from here?
-------------

Given the sample size was so small, this model can easily be improved with a larger sample size. Future research should seek to replicate these methods with the ADNI1/GO/3 databases. As in many data science problems, more data is always better, and given more time, reapplying these methods to a larger sample size would likely help model performance.

Moreover, it would be useful to attempt to create a new database with more standardized collection protocols to allow for easier analysis in future research. The lack of data was a significant hurdle to overcome in building the model and likely severely impacted its performance. This would not have been an issue if collection protocols were standardised and different databases did not require a complete rebuilding of the model.

Finally, the failure of our attempt at a longitudinal model to predict the progression of Alzheimer's dementia highlights a sorely lacking aspect of the databases: longitudinal data. Progression of the disease could very well be modeled by gene expression as well, but it is impossible to tell given the limited available data.
