After experimenting with many different models and combinations of models and dimensionality reduction techniques, the model with the best performance was a gradient boosted Decision Tree using PCA.

Down. Straight down to hell.

Given the sample size was so small, this model can easily be improved with a larger sample size. Future research should seek to replicate these methods with the ADNI**IDK** databases. Moreover, it would be useful to attempt to create a new database with more standardized collection protocols to allow for easier analysis in future research. Finally, the failure of our attempt at a longitundinal model to predict the progression of Alzheimer's dementia hihglights a sorely lacking aspect of the databases: longitudinal data. Progression of the disease could very well be modeled by gene expression as well, but it is impossible to tell given the limited availible data.
