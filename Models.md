The ultimate goal of this project was to create a model that is more predictive of Alzheimer's dementia than current methods. Using the most correlated genes, a model was constructed that outperforms both random chance and a model including all genes and models.

----------


Back to the basics: a baseline model for comparison
-------------

The baseline model is a simple logistic regression using the 10 highest and 10 lowest correlated genes with final diagnosis on the training dataset. This model managed to achieve a classification accuracy of 0.360 on the testing dataset, and 0.648 on the training dataset. However, this model is very basic, as it is a linear model, and uses only 20 genes, correlated to a single response variable. This means that it may not include all genes that could help us predict diagnosis, and also it is likely that some of these genes are randomly correlated.

On your benchmarks!
-------------
We made four models to benchmark how our models are doing: (1) predicting 0, 1, 2 randomly; (2) all 0s; (3) all 1s; and (4) all 2s. We observed the following accuracies, using a random seed of 9001 for the random class:

| Model     | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Random    | 0.306          | 0.374         |
| All zeros | 0.412          | 0.416         |
| All ones  | 0.400          | 0.421         |
| All twos  | 0.188          | 0.163         |


Ready, set, go: beyond the baseline
-------------

| Model                                    | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Decision Tree with CV for max depth      | 1.000          | 0.363         |
| Logistic Multinomial                     | 0.771          | 0.347         |
| QDA                                      | 0.888          | 0.426         |
| kNN                                      | 0.724          | 0.421         |
| AdaBoost with PCA and CV for number of estimators | 0.665          | 0.421         |


And the award goes to...
------------------
Our best model was a gradient boost algorithm with PCA and CV for number of estimators, with a test accuracy of 0.463.


Abstinence is the best policy
-------------

While the model performed well, it can be improved. The model predicts based upon the probabilities that a given patient is of a certain diagnosis. This means that a certain patient can be misdiagnosed if they are even just above the probability threshold for a given diagnosis. As the model has a decent variance, it is likely that a small number of patients with diagnosis proabilities' near the threshold will be misdiagnosed. When it comes to medical misdaignoses, this can lead to significant uncessary expenses, and should be minimized. 

Thus, we implemented a version of the model that is able to abstain in order to minimize the cost of a diagnosis. A misdiagnosis can be extremely costly, whether a false positive or false negative, in incorrect treatment, lack of early intervention, and so on; averaging potential expenditures resulted in an estimate of $12000. Abstaining from diagnosis, on the other hand, would incur an opportunity cost of approximately $6850 due to the visits to specialists and conventional diagnosis methods. In both cases, the already-paid-for cost of the genetic expression testing was considered. The model tests models with varying thresholds and then calculates the costs, outputting the optimum thresholds to minimize the costs.

This final thresholds for the model were 0.6979 for a diagnosis of cognitively normal, 0.5805 for MCI, and 0.9813 for dementia. Without thresholds, the accuracy was 0.42 and the cost per patient was $7.764,71; with thresholds, diagnosing 27% of patients, the accuracy was 0.87 and the cost per patient was $6.081,47, an improvement of nearly one thousand dollars per patient! The next-best model incurred a cost per patient of $10.042,11, so our thresholded model improved the costs by over three thousand dollars per patient: a 32% decrease!
