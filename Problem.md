Alzheimer's is the third-leading cause of death for the elderly in the United States. Every year, \$236B is spent on the costs associated with this disease. However, despite its prevalence, there is as of yet no reliable method to diagnose Alzheimer's before death, nor even predict those who may be more susceptible to the disease. Using gene expression data, we hope to be able to construct a model that can more accurately target those who may be more prone to the disease in order to seek treatment earlier.

Introduction
-------------

Alzheimer's disease is form of dementia that results in deteriorating mental capacity from its inception until the patient's death. Eventually, it will progress and the patient will become severely cognitively impaired. The disease mostly occurs in those over 60 and affects approximately 5 million Americans. This widespread disease, however, lacks a a cure, and can only be treated. Treatments for the disease typically slow the progression, but cannot cease it. 

Furthermore, Alzheimer's is difficult to diagnose. There is no way to diagnose it before death, as only an autopsy can reveal the seemingly-indicative beta-amyloid proteins, whose presence is strongly correlated with Alzheimer's disease. However, it is possible to diagnose Alzheimer's dementia, a symptom of Alzheimer's disease. This can be done through cognitive tests that seek to determine the degree of cognitive impairment a patient is experiencing, allowing doctors to attempt to predict Alzheimer's disease. Other methods include PET scans, and some biotech companies are beginning to experiment with examining gene expression data.


Why gene expression?
-------------

As mentioned, Alzheimer's typically costs US patients around 236 billion dollars in expenses every year. In order to reduce this, more efficient methods are needed to predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease. One possible method is through gene expression data. Gene expression data is far cheaper to extract than traditional PET scans, and less subjective than cognitive tests. A PET scan for amyloid plaques can cost three thousand dollars or more, while gene expression data for can be collected for only seventy to three hundred dollars. As for cognitive tests, each test is subtly different, meaning that practitioners can receive slightly different results for the same patient based upon the test administered. Gene expression data, on the other hand, is an objective metric that is cheap to obtain. This means it can serve as a powerful predictor of various genetic diseases. Given the relative success of exploratory data analysis, some genes seem to be strongly correlated to the presence of Alzheimer's, meaning a model using this data may be a significant improvement on previous methods.
