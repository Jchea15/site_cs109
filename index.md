+## Project Statement

->"Did we just cure alzheimer's?" -- our group, right before we realzed we did not.

Based on the findings of our EDA, the overall project goal remains unchanged: using the above listed databases, we will attempt to isolate genes, whose expression correlates with cognitive impairment, and use them to create a predictive model. These initial findings indicate that the project is feasible. 

In order to determine the significance of the aforementioned genes’ expression, their predictive power will need to be tested using numerous response variables, or a response variable matrix. Eventually, the significant genes should be validated on another database (such as ADNIGO or ADNI3). Furthermore, given the genes’ functions have mostly been documented, one goal of the project is to provide both significant genes, as well as a possible reason for their significance to guide further research.

Another goal is two-pronged: first, we wish to create a model using gene expression data that can accurately determine whether someone is CN, MCI, or has dementia using the smallest number of genes possible. Second, and more ambitiously, we wish to attempt to create a model using data from those whose final diagnosis is worse than their diagnosis at the time of the gene expression visit, to create a model that predicts using current gene expression whether or not someone’s condition will worsen and over which timescale; this will allow for earlier detection of Alzheimer’s by allowing gene expression while one is CN to predict whether one will become cognitively impaired in the future.
