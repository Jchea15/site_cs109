## Project Statement

>*"Did we just cure Alzheimer's?" -- our group, right before we realized we had not.*

For some patients, gene expression tests, particularly for a small number of targeted genes, may be relatively inexpensive and less invasive compared to traditional methods such as radiolabeled PET scans. This project seeks to use targetted gene expression data to help reduce the costs of diagnosing Alzheimer's dementia and aid in earlier detection. Given that Alzheimer's disease is the third leading cause of death in the elderly, early detection is critical to limiting its rate of progression. 

We  first used the ADNIMERGE database, as well as gene expression data from ADNI2 in order to isolate genes with a strong correlation to Alzheimer's dementia. Using these genes, we constructed a model that aims to diagnose Alzheimer's dementia based soley upon gene expression data, a far cheaper method of diagnosis. Furhtermore, the model was altered to be able to abstain from a diagnosis in certain cases in order to minimize the overall cost of diagnosis. This allows the model to not only minimize costs in testing, but also in treatment for those individuals who are wrongly diagnosed. 

In the end, the model managed to diagnose ______ % of patients accurately, with an average cost of ______ per patient. This is below the normal average cost of a diagnosis by $_____. With further research, it is not unrealistic to eventually expect a model based upon gene expression data to be much more accurate, significantly reducing the difficulty in predicting a disease that currently only be diagnosed post-humously.
