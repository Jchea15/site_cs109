## Project Statement

>*"Did we just cure alzheimer's?" -- our group, right before we realized we did not.*

For some patients, gene expression tests, particularly for a small number of targeted genes, may be relatively inexpensive and less invasive compared to traditional methods such as radiolabeled PET scans.

Our goal is to create a model that can determine the patient's current diagnosis based solely on their gene expression data. We will build the model by isolating the genes whose expression correlates with cognitive impairment as demonstrated on cognitive performance tests.
